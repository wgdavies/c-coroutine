## Introduction {#intro}

I've been a huge fan of coroutines since the mid-1990s.

I encountered the idea as a student, when I first read The Art of
Computer Programming. I'd been programming already for most of my
childhood, and I was completely blown away by the idea, which was
entirely new to me. In fact, it's probably not an exaggeration to say
that in the whole of TAOCP that was the single thing that changed my
life the most.

Within a few months of encountering the idea for the first time, I found
myself wanting to use it in real code, during a vacation job at a (now
defunct) tech company. Sadly I was coding in C at the time, which didn't
support coroutines. But I didn't let that stop me: I came up with a C
preprocessor trick that worked well enough to fake them, and did it
anyway.

The trick I came up with has limitations, but it's reliable enough to
use in serious code. I wrote it up a few years later in the article
'[Coroutines in
C](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)', and
I've been using it ever since, in both C and C++, whenever the code I'm
trying to write looks as if it would be most naturally expressed in that
style.

Or rather, I do that in code bases *where I can get away with it*,
because it's unquestionably a weird and unorthodox style of C by normal
standards, and not everyone is prepared to take it in their stride.
Mostly I limit my use of C-preprocessor coroutines to free software
projects where I'm the lead or only developer (in particular,
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and
[`spigot`](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/)),
because there, I get to choose what's an acceptable coding style and
what's not. The only time I've ever used the same technique in code I
wrote for an employer was in that original vacation job where I invented
the trick -- and I'm sure I only got away with it that time because my
team didn't practise code review.

Of course, I'm also happy to use coroutine-style idioms in any language
where you *don't* have to resort to trickery, such as using generators
in Python whenever it seems like a good idea.

Whenever I *can't* use coroutines, I feel limited, because it's become
second nature to me to spot parts of a program that *want* to be written
in coroutine style, and would be more awkward to express in other ways.
So I'm very much in favour of coroutines becoming more mainstream -- and
I've been pleased to see support appearing in more and more languages
over the decades. At the time of writing this, Wikipedia has an
[impressive list of
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Native_support) that
now include coroutine support; from my own perspective, the big ones are
Python generators, and the addition of a coroutine system to C++20.

I recently got round to [learning about the C++20
system](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/)
in detail. In the course of that, I had conversations about coroutines
with several friends and colleagues, which made me think more seriously
about the fact that I'm so fond of them, and wonder if I had anything
more specific to say about that than 'they're really useful'.

It turned out that I did. So this article presents my 'philosophy of
coroutines': *why* I find them so useful, what kinds of thing they're
useful for, tricks I've learned for getting the most out of them, and
even a few different ways of thinking *about* them.

But it discusses coroutines as a general concept, not specific to their
implementation in any particular language. So where I present code
snippets, they'll be in whatever language is convenient to the example,
or even in pure pseudocode.

## Why I'm so enthusiastic about coroutines {#awesome}

Go on then, why *do* I like coroutines so much?

Well, from first principles, there are two possibilities. Either it's
because they really are awesome, or it's because they suit my personal
taste. (Or a combination of the two, of course.)

I can think of arguments for both of those positions, but I don't think
I have the self-awareness to decide which is more significant. So I'll
just present both sets of arguments, and let you make up your own mind
about whether you end up also thinking they're awesome.

### The objective view: what makes them useful? {#objective}

To answer 'what makes coroutines useful?', it's useful to start by
deciding what we're *comparing* them to. I can't answer 'why is a
coroutine more useful than *X?*' without knowing what *X* we're talking
about. And there's more than one choice.

#### Versus explicit state machines {#vs-state-machines}

Two decades ago, when I wrote '[Coroutines in
C](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)', I
included an explanation of why coroutines are useful, based on the idea
that the alternative was to write an ordinary function containing an
explicit state machine.

Suppose you have a function that consumes a stream of values, and due to
the structure of the rest of your program, it has to receive each
individual value via a separate function call:

    function process_next_value(v) {
        // ...
    }

And suppose the nature of the stream is such that the way you handle
each input value depends on what the previous values were. I'll show an
example similar to the previous article, which is a simple run-length
decompressor processing a stream of input bytes: the idea is that most
input bytes are emitted literally to the output, but one byte value is
special, and is followed by a (length, output byte) pair indicating that
the output byte should be repeated a number of times.

To write that as a conventional function accepting a single byte on each
call, you have to keep a state variable of some kind to remind you of
what you were going to use the next byte for:

    function process_next_byte(byte) {
        if (state == TOP_LEVEL) {
            if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
                // emit the byte literally and stay in the same state
                output(byte);
            } else {
                // go into a state where we expect to see a run length next
                state = EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH;
            }
        } else if (state == EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH) {
            // store the length
            run_length = byte;
            // go into a state where we expect the byte to be repeatedly output
            state = EXPECT_OUTPUT;
        } else if (state == EXPECT_OUTPUT) {
            // output this byte the right number of times
            for i in (1,...,run_length)
                output(byte);
            // and go back to the top-level state for the next input byte
            state = TOP_LEVEL;
        }
    }

(This is pseudocode, so I'm not showing the details of how you arrange
for `state` and `run_length` to be preserved between calls to the
function. Whatever's convenient in your language. These days they're
probably member variables of a class, in most languages.)

This is pretty unwieldy code to write, because structurally, it looks a
lot like a collection of blocks of code connected by 'goto' statements.
They're not *literally* goto statements -- each one works by setting
`state` to some value and returning from the function -- but they have
the same semantic effect, of stating by name which part of the function
is going to be run next.

The more complicated the control structure is, the more cumbersome it
becomes to write code in this style, or to read it. Suppose I wanted to
enhance my run-length compression format so that it could efficiently
represent repetitions of a *sequence* of bytes, not just `AAAAAAA` but
`ABABABAB` or `ABCDEABCDE`? Then I wouldn't just need an *output* loop
to emit *n* copies of something; I'd also need a loop on the input side,
because the input format would probably contain an 'input sequence
length' byte followed by that many bytes of literal input. But I can't
write that one as a `for` statement, because it has to return to the
caller to get each input byte; instead, I'd have to build a 'for loop'
structure out of these small building blocks.

The more code you write in this style, the more you probably wish that
the caller and callee were the other way round. If you were writing the
same run-length decompression code in a context where you *called* a
function to read the next byte, it would look a lot more natural (not to
mention shorter), because you could call the get-byte function in
multiple places:

    function run_length_decompress(stream) {
        while (byte = stream.getbyte()) {
            if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
                output(byte);
            } else {
                run_length = stream.getbyte();
                byte_to_repeat = stream.getbyte();
                for i in (1,...,run_length)
                    output(byte_to_repeat);
            }
        }
    }

This function actually contains the same state machine as the previous
version -- but it's entirely implicit. If you want to know what each
piece of code will do when its next input byte arrives (say, during
debugging), then in the state-machine version you answer it by asking
for the value of `state` -- but in this version, you'd answer it by
looking at a stack backtrace to find out which of the calls to
`stream.getbyte()` the byte will be returned from, because that's what
controls where execution will resume from.

In other words, each of the three state values `TOP_LEVEL`,
`EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH` and `EXPECT_OUTPUT` in the state-machine code
corresponds precisely to one of the three calls to `stream.getbyte()` in
this version. So there's still a piece of data in the program tracking
which of those 'states' we're in -- but it's the *program counter*, and
doesn't need to be a named variable with a set of explicit named or
numbered state values.

And if you needed to extend *this* version of the code so that it could
read a list of input bytes to repeat, it would be no trouble at all,
because there's nothing to stop you putting a call to `stream.getbyte()`
in a loop:

                num_output_repetitions = stream.getbyte();
                num_input_bytes = stream.getbyte();
                for i in (1,...,num_input_bytes)
                    input_bytes.append(stream.getbyte());
                for i in (1,...,num_output_repetitions)
                    for byte in input_bytes
                        output(byte);

and you wouldn't have to mess around with inventing extra values in your
state enumeration, coming up with names for them, checking the names
weren't already used, renaming other states if their names had become
ambiguous, carefully writing transitions to and from existing states,
etc. You can just casually write a loop, and the programming language
takes care of the rest.

(I tend to think of the state-machine style as 'turning the function
inside out', in a more or less literal sense: the calls to a 'get byte'
function ought to be nested deeply *inside* the code's control flow, but
instead, we're forced to make them the *outermost* layer, so that 'now
wait for another byte' consists of control falling off the end of the
function, and 'ok, we've got one now, carry on' is at the top.)

Using coroutines, you can write the code in this latter style, with the
explicit state machine replaced by the implicit program counter, *even*
if the rest of the program needs to work by passing each output byte to
a function call.

In other words, you can write this part of the program 'the way it wants
to be written' -- the way that is most convenient for the nature of what
the code has to do. And you didn't have to force the *rest* of the
program to change its structure to compensate. That might have required
equally awkward contortions elsewhere, in which case you'd only have
moved the awkwardness around, and not removed it completely.

Coroutines give you greater freedom to choose the structure of each part
of your program, independently of the other parts. So each part can be
as clear as possible.

*Coroutines mean never having to turn your code inside out.*

#### Versus conventional threads {#vs-threads}

In the 1990s and early 2000s, that was the only argument I felt I needed
in favour of coroutines. But now it's 2023, and coroutines have another
competitor: multithreading.

Another way to solve the code-structure dilemma in the previous section
would be to put the decompression code into its own thread. You'd have
to set up a thread-safe method of giving it its input values -- say,
some kind of lock-protected queue or ring buffer, which would cause the
decompressor thread to block if the queue was empty, and the thread
providing the data to block if it was full. But then there would be no
reason to *pretend* either side was making a function call when it
really wasn't. Each side *really would* be making a function call to
provide an output byte or read an input byte, and there would be no
contradiction, because the call stacks of the two threads are completely
independent.

One of my software projects,
[`spigot`](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/), is a
complicated C++ program completely full of coroutines that generate
streams of data. I was chatting to a friend recently about the
possibility -- in principle -- of rewriting it in Rust. But I don't
actually know a lot about Rust yet (if I did try this, it would be a
learning experience and a half!), and so of course I asked: 'What about
all the coroutines? Would I implement those using async Rust in some
way, or what?'

My Rust-programmer friend replied: no, don't even bother. Just use
threads. Turn each of `spigot`'s coroutines into ordinary non-async Rust
code, and run it in its own thread, passing its output values to some
other thread which will block until a value is available. *It'll be
fine. Threads are cheap.*

I have to start by acknowledging my personal biases: my *first* reaction
to that attitude is purely emotional. It just gives me the
heebie-jeebies.

My own programming style has always been single-threaded wherever
possible. I mostly only use extra threads when I really can't avoid it,
usually because some operating system or library API makes it
impossible, or *astonishingly* awkward, to do a thing any other way.

^1^[For example, in the Win32 API, if you have a bidirectional file
handle such as a serial port or a named pipe, and you need to
simultaneously try to read and write it, I think it really *is* the
least inconvenient thing to have two threads, one trying to read the
handle and one trying to write it. The alternative `GetOverlappedResult`
approach ended up being *more* painful when I tried
it.]{.footnote-text}[1]{.footnote-label-right} I've occasionally gone as
far as parallelising a large number of completely independent
computations using some convenient ready-made system like Python
`multiprocessing`, but I'm at least as likely to do that kind of thing
by putting each computation into a completely separate *process*, and
parallelising them at the process level, using a `make`-type tool or GNU
`parallel`.

Partly, that's because I still think of threads as heavyweight. On
Linux, they consume a process id, and those have a limited supply.
Switching between threads requires a lot more saving and restoring of
registers than an ordinary function call, and *also* needs a transfer
from user mode to kernel mode and back, with an extra set of saves and
restores for that. The data structures you use to transfer data values
between the threads must be protected by a locking mechanism, which
costs extra time and faff. *Perhaps* all of these considerations are
minor in 2023, where they were significant in 2000? I still *feel* as if
I wouldn't want to commit to casually making 250 threads in the course
of a single `spigot` computation (which is about the number of
coroutines it constructs in the course of computing a few hundred digits
of [*e*^*π*^ − *π*](https://xkcd.com/217/)), *or* to doing a
kernel-level thread switch for every single time one of those threads
passes a tuple of four integers to another. `spigot` is slow enough as
it is -- and one of my future ambitions for it is to be able to
parallelise 1000 of *those* computations! But I have to admit that I
haven't actually tried this strategy and benchmarked it. So *maybe* I
have an outdated idea of what it would cost.

Also, I think of threads as *dangerous*. You have to do all that locking
and synchronisation to prevent race conditions, and it's often
complicated, and easy to get wrong. My instinct is to view any
non-trivial use of threads as 100 data-race bugs waiting to happen. (And
if you manage to avoid all of those, probably half a dozen deadlocks
hiding behind them!) Now in this *particular* conversation we were
talking about Rust, and that's a special case on this count, because
Rust's unique selling point is to guarantee that your program is free of
data races by the time you've managed to get it to compile at all. But
in more or less any other language I think I'm still right to be scared!

So I have strong prejudices against 'just use real threads, it'll be
fine'. But I accept that I *might* be wrong about those. Supposing I am,
are there any other arguments for using coroutines instead?

One nice feature of everything being in the same system thread is
debuggability. If you're using an interactive debugger, you don't have
to worry about which thread you're debugging, or which thread a
breakpoint applies to: if the whole overall computation is happening in
the same thread then you can just place a breakpoint in the normal way
and it will be hit.

And if you prefer debugging via 'recompile with print statements',
that's *also* more convenient in a single-threaded setup where the
transfers of control are explicit, because you don't have to worry about
adding extra locks to ensure the debug messages themselves are atomic
when multiple threads are producing them. You might not mind having to
do fiddly lock-administration when you're setting up the *real* data
flow of your program, but it definitely slows down investigation if you
have to do it for every throwaway print statement!

But another nice thing about coroutines is that they're easy to
*abandon*. If a thread is in the middle of blocking on a lock, and you
suddenly discover you no longer need that thread (and, perhaps, not the
one it was blocking on either, or 25 surrounding threads), then
depending on your language's threading system, it can get very painful
to arrange to interrupt all those threads and terminate them. Even if
you manage it at all, will all the resources they were holding get
cleaned up? (File descriptors closed, memory freed, etc.)

I don't think thread systems are generally great at this. But coroutines
*are*: a suspended coroutine normally has an identity as some kind of
actual object in your programming language, and if you destroy or delete
or free it, then you can normally arrange for it to be cleaned up in a
precise manner, freeing any resources.

Using `spigot` as an example again: most of its coroutines run
indefinitely, and are prepared to yield an infinite stream of data if
you want them to. At some point the ultimate consumer of the whole
computation decides it's got enough output, and destroys the entire web
of connected coroutines. Using C++ with preprocessor-based coroutines,
this is reliably achieved with zero memory leaks. I'd hate to have to
figure out how to terminate 250 actual system threads as cleanly.

Also, having a language object identifying the coroutine instance can be
used for other stunt purposes. I'll talk more about that in [a later
section](#named-object).

So *I* still prefer coroutines to threads. But I have to acknowledge
that my reasons are a little bit more borderline than the reasons in the
previous section.

(However, this discussion is all about *pre-emptive* threads.
*Cooperative* threads which yield to each other explicitly are a
different matter, and I'll talk about those [later](#cothreads) as
well.)

### The subjective view: why do *I* like them so much? {#subjective}

This is already the kind of essay where I acknowledge my own bias. So I
should also admit the possibility that it's not so much that coroutines
are objectively amazing, but rather, that they appealed especially
strongly to *me personally* for some reason that doesn't apply to
everybody.

I have a couple of theories about what that reason might be, if there is
one.

#### "Teach the student when the student is ready" {#student-ready}

One possibility is that the concept was presented to me at exactly the
right stage in my education.

I'd already been programming for a number of years when I read TAOCP, so
I'd already felt for myself the frustration of having to write a piece
of code 'inside out' -- that is, in the form of an explicit state
machine that I'd rather have avoided -- and I hadn't thought of any way
to make that less annoying. So when Donald Knuth helpfully presented me
with one, I pounced on it with gratitude.

But if I'd encountered the idea of coroutines earlier, *before* I'd felt
that frustration, then I might not have appreciated it as much. It would
have been one among many concepts that went through my brain as I read
the books, and I'd have thought, 'ok, fine, I expect that's useful for
*something*', and then I'd have forgotten it (along with half of the
rest of TAOCP, because there's a *lot* of stuff in there!). And perhaps
I might not have managed to recall it later, when the problem did appear
in my life.

Conversely, the idea of coroutines might *also* have had less impact on
me if I'd learned about it *later*. I have a strong suspicion that if
I'd spent another (say) five years writing pieces of code inside out
because I had no idea there was another option, I'd have got much
*better* at writing code inside out, and much more used to it, and then
the opportunity to avoid having to do it wouldn't have seemed like such
a huge boon any more.

Also, by that time, I'd probably have thought of some actual advantages
to the inside-out state-machine style of coding, and started making use
of them. There are often silver linings to be found in situations like
this. In this case I can't say for sure what they might be (since I
never *did* become that practised at the skill); but one possibility
that springs to mind is that an explicit list of states might make
exhaustive testing more convenient (you can ensure you've tested every
state and every transition). But whatever the compensating advantage
might be, once I'd noticed it, I'd have been reluctant to lose it for
the sake of (as I would have seen it) not *that* much extra convenience.

(This is probably related to Paul Graham's idea of the [Blub
Paradox](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html), in which you look at a
less powerful language than your favourite one and you *know* it's less
powerful, because it lacks some feature you're used to, and you can't
imagine how you'd get anything done without that. But you look at a more
powerful language that has features yours doesn't, and whatever they
are, you seem to have been getting along fine without them -- so you
conclude that they can't be *that* important, and that the 'more
powerful' language isn't that much better really.)

So perhaps it's just that coroutines hit me at precisely my moment of
peak frustration with exactly the problem they solve, and that's why I
adopted them with so much enthusiasm.

#### They suit my particular idea of code clarity {#clarity}

When you look at an existing piece of code, there are two different ways
you might want to understand it.

One way is: *on its own terms, what does this code do, and how do I
modify it to do it differently?* For example, in the [decompressor
example](#vs-state-machines) a few sections ago, suppose you wanted to
look at the code and figure out what the compressed data format was --
either to write a specification, or to check it against an existing
specification. Or suppose someone had just *changed* the specification
for the compressed data format, and you had to adjust the code for the
new spec.

For that purpose, it doesn't really matter how the code fits into the
rest of the program. In fact you don't even need to *see* the rest of
the program. You could figure out the format from *either* of the code
snippets I showed (the one with a state machine, or the one that calls
`stream.getbyte()`), and it wouldn't matter at all that the rest of the
program hasn't even been written. In both cases, you can see that the
code is getting a stream of bytes from *somewhere*, be it a caller or a
subroutine; you can follow the logic through and see what bytes cause
what effects; if you're updating the code, you just have to follow the
existing idioms for input and output.

But although you *can* do that level of work on either version of the
code, it's much easier to do it on the version that calls a 'get byte'
function. At least, I think so; if anyone actually finds the state
machine version *easier* to work with in that kind of way, I'd be
interested to know why!

But the other way you might want to understand a piece of code is: *how
does this fit into the rest of the program, and how can I change that?*
If you had no interest at all in the compressed data format and no
reason to think this decompressor was delivering incorrect output, but
you were concerned with what was being done *next* with the data being
decompressed, then you'd want to find out not 'what bytes are output,
and how can I change that?', but 'when a byte is output, where does it
go next, and is it the right place, and how do I reroute it to somewhere
else?'.

For *this* purpose, coroutines often make things less clear, rather than
more. That's especially true if they're based on my C preprocessor
system, because a person coming fresh to a function in that style is
going to see some weirdo `crReturn` macro, look up the definition, be
further baffled (it's fairly confusing if you don't already recognise
the trick), and probably conclude that I'm throwing obstacles in their
path on purpose! But other less ad-hoc coroutine systems have the same
property; for example, in C++20 coroutines, the mechanism for dealing
with yielded data values lives in a 'promise class' type, which is
inferred from the type signature of the coroutine itself by a system of
template specialisations that could be almost anywhere in the source
file or any of its header files. If there isn't clear documentation
somewhere in your code base, it might be legitimately quite hard to find
out what happens to data after it leaves a C++20 coroutine; you might
very well find that the simplest way to answer the question was to step
through the yield in a debugger and see what happened next.

Which of these kinds of clarity is more important? Of course, both of
them *are* important, because both are things you might need to
understand, or fix, or update in your code. But if you spend 90% of time
working on the code in one of those ways, and 10% of your time in the
other way, you're going to prefer the kind of clarity that helps you 90%
of the time over the kind that helps you 10% of the time.

And it so happens that my own preference skews towards the first kind.
Perhaps that has to do with the types of program I work on. All my life
I've gravitated to programs that solve complicated problems, because
that's the kind of thing I enjoy doing. In those programs, the
individual subproblems are complicated and so are the pieces of code
that deal with them; the data flow between them is a small part of the
overall system. So I don't want to make debugging each sub-piece of code
harder, just for the sake of making the data flow more explicit. I'd
rather each piece made sense on its own terms at the expense of the data
flow being a little more opaque.

This is also one example of a more general question. Is it better for
each program to effectively define its own local customised variant of
the language it's written in (via very elaborate support libraries,
metaprogramming tricks like macros, and the like), so that the learning
curve takes a long time to climb, but you can work really effectively
once you've climbed it? Or is it better to avoid diverging too much from
the standard ways to use a language, so that a new programmer can get up
to speed quickly?

Again, my preference skews toward the former. I value the ability to
make my own life easier if I'm spending a long time in a code base. And
I don't much mind climbing the learning curves for other people's
differently customised coding environments, because I often learn
something in the process (and maybe steal any good ideas I find). But I
know that there are other people who are much more in favour of sticking
to the orthodoxy.

(However, that's only an argument against coroutines as long as they
*aren't* the orthodoxy. With more mainstream adoption, perhaps this
argument is weakening. Generators in Python are *definitely* mainstream
now: I've occasionally had a code reviewer tell me to use them *more!*)

## Techniques for getting the most out of coroutines {#technique}

Of course, another reason why one person might find a language feature
more useful than someone else is that they're better at using it: better
at spotting cases where it's useful, better at getting the most out of
it when they do use it. And let's not forget the skill of *avoiding*
using it when it *isn't* useful, so that you don't get annoyed by
situations where it's not really a good fit.

Here's a collection of my thoughts on when and how to use coroutines for
best effect.

### When to use coroutines, and when not to {#when}

My first general piece of advice is: *don't be all-or-nothing about it*.
Coroutines are useful in many situations, but they're not the best tool
for *every* job.

Programming language features are conveniences, not moral imperatives.
They exist to make your life easier. So in a case where a feature
*doesn't* make your life easier, it's OK not to use it.

(As far as I'm concerned, this applies to any language feature, not just
coroutines. Another good example is recursion: it's a very powerful and
useful technique, but I have no time for languages that force you to use
it for *everything*, even simple looping constructions. Especially if
they also require you to learn all the tricks of passing extra
parameters to permit tail recursion: to my way of thinking, that's a
clear sign that you're trying to turn something into recursion that
doesn't really *want* to be written that way. Similarly, not everything
needs to be a class -- sorry, Java -- and not everything needs to be
immutable -- sorry, Haskell. Multi-paradigm is the One True Way, because
it's the only way that doesn't insist that there's a One True Way!)

As I said in an earlier section, precisely one of the good things about
coroutines is that they give you the freedom to structure each part of a
program in the way that's most useful, independently of the rest. In
particular, that includes the freedom to *not* use a coroutine in a
particular situation, if you don't want to!

Coroutines are useful when successive calls to a function need to behave
differently, in a way that 'looks like control flow'. That's hard to
define, but after a while, you know the kind of thing when you see it:
if the full sequence of function calls wants to exhibit a number of
different behaviours one after another, or repeat an action lots of
times with different actions coming before and after it, or diverge into
two totally different sequences of operations based on some input
condition (especially if you then re-converge into some later behaviour
that looks the same regardless), or most especially repeat a sequence of
things that *also* include sub-repetitions and conditionals of their
own. Those are all the kinds of thing that would be very natural to
write using sequential code, or loops, or if-statements, or nestings of
those things -- so once you recognise that 'control flow nature',
consider writing it as *actual* control flow, in a coroutine.

On the other hand, some things just *don't need* to be coroutines. If a
function needs to do basically the same thing every time, you *could*
write it as a coroutine anyway, containing nothing but an infinite
'while true: do thing' loop, but there wouldn't be any real point.
That's just boilerplate that makes simple code more complicated for the
sake of it. In that situation, don't bother!

### Types of code that might usefully become coroutines {#use-cases}

Just waving my hands and saying 'spot things that look like control
flow' isn't the most helpful advice in the world, of course! So in this
next section I'll mention some things I've found them useful for in the
past.

In coming up with the list, I found it convenient to categorise
coroutines according to whether they yield to get inputs or to produce
output or both, and to what other pieces of code.

#### Output only: generators {#generator}

One of the simplest kinds of coroutine, and perhaps the most familiar to
at least Python programmers

^2^[I talk about generators as if they were *the* coroutine system in
Python, but in fact, they're one of two: Python *also* has a [completely
different kind of
thing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines)
that it actually uses the name 'coroutine' for, in which function
definitions start with `async def` and suspend with `await`. I've never
played with those, because generators are easier to get started with and
have scratched my generalised coroutine itch well enough. But at some
point I should at least give them a
look.]{.footnote-text}[2]{.footnote-label-right}, is the kind that
yields values to a consumer, but its input comes either from the
parameters it was passed on creation, or from ordinary function calls.

(Of course, those function calls might be to the 'next' method of other
generators, in which case you can look at this as taking input from a
different coroutine after all! But only semantically: in a [later
section](#resumable-callee) I'll mention a performance concern relating
to this.)

If a coroutine only generates output, then there's a third alternative
to making it a coroutine (as well as the state-machine and thread
options discussed earlier): you can simply make it compute *all* its
output ahead of time, and return it in full as a list or array. This
gives you all the same advantages in terms of writing the control flow
in a natural and readable style. For example, here are two versions of a
simple function that finds the 'record-breaking' values in a list, i.e.
every value that is larger than all the ones before it:

::::: flexcontainer
::: flexitem
    # Written as a generator
    def record_breaking_values(inputs):
        it = iter(inputs)
        best = next(it)
        yield best
        for value in it:
            if value > best:
                best = value
                yield best
:::

::: flexitem
    # Ordinary function that just returns a list
    def record_breaking_values(inputs):
        it = iter(inputs)
        best = next(it)
        records = [best]
        for value in it:
            if value > best:
                best = value
                records.append(best)
        return records
:::
:::::

In that example, the 'just return a list' function is one line longer
because of the actual `return` statement. But that's a trivial concern.
(And I could have made it a line shorter instead, if I'd eliminated the
`best` variable and just checked `records[-1]`, but then the two pieces
of code wouldn't have matched so clearly.) The point is that the control
flow inside the function is exactly the same, and the algorithm is
equally clear to a reader, and equally easy to modify.

The advantages of the coroutine version over this are space and time.
The space advantage is obvious: if that returned list is *long*, then
it's nicer to avoid ever having to store all of it in memory at once,
and instead, throw away each value after it's been used. This doesn't
reduce flexibility, because (at least in Python) there's a very concise
idiom for turning the output of a generator back into a list at the call
site if you really do need it all available at once.

(Of course, this is exactly the same reason that Unix provides a system
for piping data between processes, in place of the more obvious approach
of writing the data to an intermediate temporary file. One way to look
at coroutines is that they're the in-process analogue of a Unix pipe

^3^[In TAOCP, one of Knuth's suggestions for a producer/consumer chain
is that you might be flexible enough to make a runtime decision as to
*whether* to run both parts interleaved as coroutines, or whether to run
them sequentially storing the intermediate data on disk, depending on
how much memory you have. I suspect this was a more vital concern in the
1970s.]{.footnote-text}[3]{.footnote-label-right}!)

The time advantages are more subtle. In fact it's not immediately
obvious how there's a time advantage at all: surely the same
*calculations* have to happen, whether we select the record-breaking
values in advance of using them or interleaved with using them.

And, of course, that's true. If we really are going to use *all* the
returned data, then the *overall* time taken to do the calculations is
the same.

But sometimes we're concerned with intermediate timings as well as the
overall time. For example, if an interactive program needs to output the
next value in a sequence when the user performs a UI action, then it's
nicer if the time taken to compute that value is reasonably bounded,
rather than the program *occasionally* saying "Hold on, I need to
precompute the next 10000 items before I can give you the first of
them..."

And sometimes we're *not* intending to use all of the returned data.
Another way to look at generator-style coroutines like this is that
they're a form of *lazy evaluation*: no value in the logical output list
is computed until another part of the program actually needs it, and
that means that if *nothing* ever needs the value, we never wasted the
time of computing it. In the interactive scenario, you'd be
*particularly* annoyed at the program wasting your time on precomputing
the next 10000 output values if you were intending to look at the first
ten and then quit the program!

One special case of this, where you *really can't* compute the entire
intermediate list up front, is if the intermediate list is potentially
infinite! Some natural generators will just keep on and on generating
data, and the only way to *ever* stop them is by their consumer getting
bored and discarding them.

In any case, the takeaway from this is: any time you see a function that
constructs and returns a list, if it functions in more or less 'append
only' mode (that is, it builds the list up from start to finish, and
doesn't have to refer back to an unlimited number of the existing items
to decide what to append next), it's worth considering whether it would
be clearer written as a generator-style coroutine instead, if your
language makes it convenient.

#### Input only: consumers {#consumer}

If I've had a section for output-only coroutines, then obviously I need
a section for input-only ones.

At least in normal languages where a coroutine is a special kind of
function, these don't often seem to be very useful. It's commonplace to
have one piece of code producing data and passing it to another that
consumes it, but you usually only need *one* of them to be a special
coroutine- or generator-type function; the other can just be a normal
non-coroutine-style function that invokes the producer coroutine when it
needs another item, e.g. by calling `next()` on a Python generator.

You generally *can* write the two pieces of code the other way round, so
that the producer is an ordinary function and the consumer is a
coroutine. But it doesn't often seem to be the easiest way to do things.

Partly, that's because languages don't make it quite as easy. In Python,
for example, you *can* pass data to a generator by calling
`g.send(value)` and retrieve it inside the routine as the return value
of the `yield` operator; but it's awkward that the generator starts off
in a state where its code hasn't run at all yet, so you have to faff
with it to get it to the point of first input. But other systems don't
have this awkwardness, or at least, you can arrange not to have it; for
example, C++20 coroutines allow you to configure whether your coroutine
should start off suspended, or run to the point of first yield / await.
(Or other options.)

More importantly, the consumer end of the data pipeline is probably the
one that's taking the program's main action. So you probably want to
make *sure* it completes. I mentioned above that one of the virtues of
coroutines is often that they're safely discardable (via the language's
cleanup or destructor system) if you want to abandon the computation
half way through -- but that stops being a virtue if the computation in
question is the one you want to be sure of *not* accidentally
abandoning!

So I think it generally makes sense to have the producer end of the
system be an easily discardable coroutine, and the consumer end be
'normal' code. That way, if the producer encounters an exceptional
condition and can't carry on producing data (e.g. a file it was reading
from ended abruptly, or contained invalid data), the consumer can catch
the exception and ensure it does something sensible, like switching to a
fallback strategy, or deleting its half-written output file, or at the
very least producing a useful error message. You probably don't want it
to be silently discarded.

#### Separate input and output: adapters {#adapter}

Once you've connected a producer to a consumer, the next natural step is
to have something in the middle be both at once, consuming values from
one side and emitting them to the other side.

The `record_breaking_values()` example I showed in Python earlier is
already an example of one of those, depending on how you look at it. If
you pass it a static thing like a list, then it's just a producer
coroutine, doing computation based on its original parameters; but if
you pass it another generator as an argument, then it 'yields' to that
generator by calling `next()` on it, and yields to its consumer by using
the actual `yield` statement.

There are lots of natural adapters of this kind that you might usefully
write as coroutines. Again, it's not *always* the right thing to write
them that way, but it can very easily be.

For example, here's a tiny Python generator function that I put in a lot
of my programs, because I often find I want to use it, and despite being
so simple, it's not in the standard library:

    def cyclic_pairs(inputs):
        it = iter(inputs)
        prev = first = next(it)
        for curr in it:
            yield prev, curr
            prev = curr
        yield prev, first

Given a list of inputs such as *a*,*b*,*c*,*d*,*e*, this returns each
pair of adjacent list elements as a tuple, so that you get (*a*,*b*),
(*b*,*c*), (*c*,*d*) and (*d*,*e*) as outputs

^4^[The non-cyclic version of this is also useful. As of Python 3.10
that *is* in the standard library, as `itertools.pairwise`, although I'm
going to have to keep writing it by hand until I can rely on Python 3.10
or better being widespread enough. But as far as I know the cyclic
version still isn't in
`itertools`.]{.footnote-text}[4]{.footnote-label-right}. Finally, it
produces the pair that 'wraps round the end', consisting of the last
element and the first, in this case (*e*,*a*).

If you knew the input was in the form of an already-complete list, you
could write this easily enough by iterating over the list indices, and
returning `(list[i], list[(i+1) % len(list)])`. But if you write it in
this form then it can take any iterable as input -- including another
generator, which perhaps doesn't even know what all its output is going
to be yet.

What makes this a natural use case for generators? It's the special
cases at the start and the end

^5^[Incidentally, yes, I know, there's another special case that my code
doesn't handle: if the input iterator has *no* values, then the example
version of `cyclic_pairs` shown here will raise `StopIteration`, when
perhaps you'd prefer it to silently generate an empty output list.
Before Python 3.7 this happened automatically, because `StopIteration`
was handled differently; in many of my own use cases I never pass an
empty list anyway. But if you were writing a version general enough to
go in `itertools`, you'd probably want to check for that case
properly.]{.footnote-text}[5]{.footnote-label-right}. If every input
value was treated exactly the same, then you could just as easily write
this as a tiny class storing the `prev` variable, with a `__call__`
method that constructed each tuple and updated `prev`. But in reality,
the *first* element from the input iterator must be treated specially
(in that we still put it into `prev` but don't yield a tuple at all),
and when we reach the end, we have an extra thing to do (namely yielding
that final wraparound tuple). You *could* fake that up in your class,
perhaps by special-casing `prev=None` (but what if the input iterator
contained some legitimate `None` values itself?), or more likely by a
system of flag variables in the class. But then you're in 'explicit
state machine when you didn't really want one' territory -- so it's
easier just to write code like this, which says directly, in sequence,
what things you want to do, in what order.

Adapters like this fit nicely into the 'Unix pipeline' model, as I
described a couple of sections earlier. So they're still only a
performance improvement, in space and maybe time, over doing things the
pedestrian way with intermediate lists.

#### Input and output talking to the same entity: protocols {#protocol}

Now we come to the case where coroutines deliver more than a performance
optimisation: where they do both input and output, but the output goes
to the *same entity* that's providing the input.

It doesn't exactly matter what that entity *is*: it might be another
part of the same program, or it might be a human interacting with the
program, or it might be another program at the far end of a network
connection. But if the entity at the other end has to see your outputs
so far before deciding what your next input is, and you have to do the
same to generate *your* next output, then this type of coroutine *can't*
be rewritten as a function that just generates the whole output list up
front.

One of Knuth's examples in TAOCP was a piece of code that implements a
chess-playing algorithm. That's exactly a case of this kind: each time
you output a move, you have to wait to find out what my responding move
is before you can even decide what moves you can *legally* play next,
let alone which one is best. You can imagine a function like this
talking to a human player through some user interface code -- but you
could also set two copies of it playing against each other, yielding
control flow back and forth each time one of them made a move.

(On the other hand, I don't know that chess is a good case for coroutine
style, because as far as I know, chess algorithms these days work by
analysing whatever board position they're given, and if they retain any
state from the previous move it will only be in the form of cached
evaluations of potential future game states. So a 'next chess move'
function probably wouldn't want to be a coroutine after all. But some
games' rules -- or optimal strategies -- *do* go through sequential
phases that would suggest a coroutine-structured playing function.)

But gaming is a frivolous use of this idea. A much more practical one is
network protocols. The reason coroutines occur throughout PuTTY is
because they're so useful for implementing sequential network protocols,
under the constraint that the top level of your program is an event loop
waiting for whatever input event happens next out of network
connections, user input, and sometimes timers.

A good example is the key exchange layer of the SSH protocol. The two
sides exchange setup packets that list all the different cryptographic
algorithms they're prepared to use; out of those options, they select
the best one that both sides understand, and then exchange several
packets to perform a key exchange according to that algorithm. Having
done that, each side installs a new set of cryptographic keys, and then
exchange encrypted packets implementing the actual interactive login
session -- until one side decides it's time to refresh the cryptography,
and sends another key-exchange setup packet.

The sequence of packets within each key exchange method is different;
only one of those sequences is used; and the whole thing takes place in
a loop, restarting every time a new key exchange is needed. These are
all markers of 'looks like control flow', and make it very natural to
write the code in a style like this:

    function key_exchange() {
        send(KEXINIT); // key exchange initialisation packet
        wait for other side’s KEXINIT;
        outer loop {
            decide what key exchange type we’re doing;
            if (it’s this type) {
                send this;
                expect that;
                send some response;
            } else if (it’s some other type) {
                expect the other side to send a packet first;
                send a totally different response packet;
            } else {
                // potentially more and more cases like this
            }
            install new keys;
            inner loop {
                get next packet from server;
                if (it’s KEXINIT) {
                    // time to do another key exchange
                    send our own KEXINIT;
                    break from inner loop; // so we return to top of outer loop
                } else {
                    pass the packet on to the next layer up;
                }
            }
        }
    }

This function is structured as if it's calling a subroutine to retrieve
the next packet from the other side of the connection. But in reality,
it's going to *be* called each time a packet arrives -- so we have to
either make it a coroutine, or turn it inside out by setting up an
explicit state machine. I think keeping the code in this nice sequential
form is *far* preferable, so coroutines it is!

In fact, this kind of pattern recurs throughout SSH. The 'packets' that
are arriving in the code shown above are built up from the actual stream
of bytes coming from the network by means of reading an initial few
bytes giving the packet length, then reading that many more bytes to get
the rest of the packet, then reading the authentication code at the end
(if any); doing all the decryption and integrity checking, and finally,
having a packet available to output. This code too wants to be written
in a style where it calls a 'wait for *n* more bytes of network data'
function -- but, again, it's *being* called from the main event loop
when data comes in on the network socket. So that layer too is a
coroutine, in the simpler 'adapter' style where the input and output are
separate: it consumes bytes from the event loop, and periodically yields
a completed packet to the key-exchange layer shown above.

And the 'next layer up' -- mentioned at the end of the above pseudocode
-- does all of this *again*. Initially, it's the user-authentication
layer of SSH, which might prompt for a password, or use a public key, or
do something more complicated still; any of those might fail, in which
case it has to loop back round and try the next fallback approach. So
that's very natural to write as a coroutine as well. The whole structure
of SSH is almost *designed* to be three coroutines stacked on top of
each other!

(Once you've actually logged in, things get a bit less coroutiney. The
'connection layer' that takes care of running shell sessions is much
less sequential. In PuTTY, it's still structured as a coroutine, but
*mostly* that coroutine sits in an endless while loop just responding to
each packet as it comes in. That would normally be the kind of boring
stateless code that it's not really worth making into a coroutine at all
-- except that right at the start we have to do a few setup tasks like
opening an initial session channel, so the coroutine consists of a small
amount of sequential setup code and *then* the boring while loop.)

This isn't an article about SSH alone, of course. That's just a
particularly good example. Many other network protocols are just as
sequential. For example, PuTTY's code to connect via an HTTP proxy is
also structured as a coroutine.

In fact, that code has an extra wrinkle too. Sometimes, when
authentication fails in HTTP, you can try again within the same network
connection; but sometimes you have to close the connection to the HTTP
server and open a fresh one. So there's not just a sequence of
operations *within* a network connection: there's also a sequence of
*connections* involved. In PuTTY, this is all handled with a single HTTP
proxy coroutine: sometimes it yields a special return value to its
caller saying 'please close the connection, open a fresh one, and call
me back when that one's ready'. Then it can go back round to the top of
its loop and continue trying to authenticate.

#### More general, and miscellaneous {#uc-general}

In all of the previous subsections, I've shown coroutines with at most
one input channel and at most one output. Of course, you can also have
more than one of each.

There are two conceptually different ways that a coroutine might consume
two input streams. One is that it yields to a *specific* input stream
each time it wants a new value, so that it's in control of how fast the
two input streams deliver data. There are lots of examples of this in
purely computational contexts: consider, for example, a function that
merges two sorted lists, or zips together two or more streams by making
a tuple of one element from each stream, or other things of the kind you
might find in Python `itertools`.

The other approach, more suited to coroutines that are doing
asynchronous I/O, is that the coroutine might yield in such a way that
it will be resumed when *any* of the input streams has data available --
no matter which one it is. For example, some of PuTTY's SSH coroutines
have to handle both network data and user input: the user authentication
coroutine will sometime respond to a network packet by presenting a
password prompt to the user, and then it has to receive the password
that the user typed in return and construct the network reply packet.
But there's no guarantee of which is going to happen next, out of a
network packet arriving and the user pressing a key. So the coroutine is
resumed whenever *either* one happens.

That style of coroutine is tricky to write well, and I have some advice
about it in later sections. Here, I just mention that it's among the
possibilities.

Another slightly unexpected 'stunt' use of coroutines is to use them to
reconstruct the call-stack structure of ordinary subroutines: replace
every normal function call with a coroutine-style yield operation which
makes a newly constructed instance of the subroutine start running next,
and whenever a coroutine terminates, resume the one that invoked it.

Why on earth is *that* a useful thing to do, you might ask? If we want
something that behaves like an ordinary function call stack, doesn't the
typical programming language have one built in already?

I've found that useful in the past as a means of working around
limitations of the true function call stack. In Python, for example, you
can only nest function calls about 1000 deep, and I've sometimes needed
to recurse much more deeply than that -- e.g. running graph algorithms
over a DAG with very long chains, such as a git repository. It's
surprisingly convenient to rewrite function calls and returns in a style
like this...

::::: flexcontainer
::: flexitem
    # Before
    def routine(x):
        i = subroutine(x+1)
        j = subroutine(x*i)
        return i+j
:::

::: flexitem
    # After
    def routine(x):
        i = yield Call(subroutine(x+1))
        j = yield Call(subroutine(x*i))
        yield Return(i+j)
:::
:::::

... and then have a small piece of 'executor' code which maintains a
stack of currently active generators in an array, and contains a loop
which always resumes the innermost generator on the stack. If that
yields a `Call` object containing another generator, push that one on
the stack, so that it will be the one resumed next; if it yields a
`Return` containing a return value, pop the stack, and pass the value to
the new topmost generator when it's resumed.

When I've done this in the past, my reason has always been to get round
Python's recursion depth limit. But I can think of other reasons for
reifying your stack into explicit data objects.

One reason is so that those objects can be saved and restored. Given the
right language support, you might be able to tweak a system like this to
allow the entire state of a half-finished recursive computation to be
written out to a disk file; then the program could be terminated, and
when run again later, reload the file and carry on from where it left
off. (Although you would also need a method of saving the *internal*
state of each coroutine, which might be harder.)

Another is that once you replace the language's built-in control flow
with your own imitation, it becomes easy to extend or modify it. You
could imagine adding a third kind of data object alongside `Call` and
`Return` which had a different effect on the executor. For example, you
might have two or more call stacks and switch between them, implementing
'co-threads' (which I'll talk about more in [a later
section](#cothreads)).

In fact, perhaps you might decide that keeping the active function calls
in an array was itself a limitation you wanted to go beyond. Not all
languages insist on a linear stack in that way. Scheme, for example, has
multiple control-flow features (continuations and `dynamic-wind`) with
the effect that the stack is replaced by a general DAG of function
activations, and several branches of the DAG can be resumable. (This
also means that the stack frames must be subject to garbage collection.)
A technique like this could be used to implement continuations in
languages that don't have them natively!

Speaking of messing about with control flow, another stunt use of
coroutines -- in the right context -- is to invent your own control flow
*statements*, alongside standard things like 'for', 'while' and 'if'.

Some languages encourage you to invent control flow primitives of your
own, by means of making it easy to pass blocks of code to a function
call:

    function my_control_structure(code) {
        set up stuff;
        while (some condition)
            code.run();
        clean up stuff;
    }

    # now the braced block becomes the ‘code’ parameter to the above function
    my_control_structure {
        statements;
    }

The *wrong* way to implement this language feature is to literally wrap
up the code block at the call site into a lambda function, and have the
control-structure function execute the block using a normal function
call. The problem with this is that then the code blocks don't really
run in the context of the containing function. They might be able to
access the function's local variables, by virtue of lexically scoped
lambda capture, but the control flow is isolated. If one of those blocks
executes a 'return' statement, then it only returns from the *block*,
not the containing function (as it would if you executed the same return
inside, say, a while loop). And if you want to 'break' from a loop
implemented by these means, then executing the 'break' statement inside
the lambda doesn't work at all. This all makes your artificial control
structure look 'second class' compared to the language's built-in ones.

Instead of doing that, the *right* way -- and some languages actually do
this, such as Ruby -- is for the control-structure function to be a
coroutine. Instead of its code blocks being ordinary functions that it
calls in the ordinary way, they should remain in the context of the
original function, and the control structure should *yield* back to the
original function, telling it which block to run next. Then custom
control structures would be just as good as the standard ones, and
wouldn't behave surprisingly differently in edge cases

^6^[In my fantasy programming language, this would *actually* be how the
standard control structures were implemented. The only primitives in the
language itself would be 'goto' and coroutines. *All* block-structured
control flow commands, even the standard things like 'if', 'for' and
'while', would be defined in the standard prelude as small coroutines of
this kind, implemented in terms of 'goto'. Then they wouldn't need to be
keywords!]{.footnote-text}[6]{.footnote-label-right}.

Of course, if you're not using a language that already works this way,
then finding a way to implement it can be tricky or impossible. But once
I just about found a way to do it in C, combining my [preprocessor
coroutine
system](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)
with [another preprocessor
trick](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/mp/) for making
custom control structures at all. In C++ you might do it more easily by
having the macro at the call site expand to a range-`for` loop. It will
depend on the language.

### Coroutines large and small {#large-and-small}

That 'control flow nature' that makes a piece of code a natural fit for
coroutines can occur at all scales, from the largest to the smallest.

Among the examples in previous sections, I've already shown examples at
both ends of that spectrum. Some of the largest and most complicated
parts of PuTTY's SSH code, such as the key exchange or the user
authentication protocol layers, are implemented as a giant coroutine. On
the other hand, that tiny `cyclic_pairs` Python generator is not far off
being the smallest possible piece of coroutine-shaped code that's worth
bothering to write.

It's also worth considering various ways to slice up, or break down, the
problem. In SSH the multiple protocol layers lend themselves nicely to
being a coroutine *each*; they'd be much more unwieldy implemented as
one single one. On the other hand, for some network protocols, a single
coroutine might be suitable for running the entire network connection.

And in some other situations, you might have a variable number of
coroutines, with each one tracking the progress of a single transaction
*within* a network protocol. I have an example of that too in the PuTTY
code: the SSH agent, Pageant, is mostly a non-coroutine loop that
answers queries in whatever order they arrive -- but whenever a client
of the agent requests a signature from one of Pageant's private keys, it
spawns a small coroutine to handle the progress of *that specific
signing request*, because sometimes it will need to prompt the user for
a passphrase, loop round again if that didn't work, be prepared to
abandon the attempt if the user clicks Cancel, etc. This is all
control-flow-shaped code -- but it suited the problem best to have a
coroutine for *each* signature request, not one for the whole
connection.

So, when you're on the lookout for coroutine-shaped parts of a program,
don't forget to look for the large ones, the small ones, and everything
in between!

#### Activation energy

Of course, depending on the language, that might not be good advice
after all.

In Python, writing a generator is made extremely easy. It's no harder
than an ordinary function; you just write `yield` at least once in the
body, and everything is taken care of for you. So there's no reason I
*shouldn't* write things like that `cyclic_pairs()` function as a
generator, if it's only a tiny bit clearer. There's essentially no cost.
The next five lines of my code would look a bit nicer as a generator?
Fine, dash off a generator, why not?

But if you were writing in C++20, there's a much higher barrier to
entry. C++20 coroutines are [very
expensive](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/)
to set up -- not so much in runtime cost (though I'm sure there is
*some*), but in programming effort. You have to write a whole 'promise
class' with lots of methods explaining how the coroutine should behave
in this or that circumstance. If the only actual coroutine you wanted to
write was going to save you (say) five lines of code, then writing a
whole C++20 promise class from scratch wouldn't be a net win, because it
would cost you a hundred or so lines to set up the necessary
infrastructure. You have to *really want* coroutines to bother setting
them up in a C++20 program.

However, C++20 does let you reuse the promise class for multiple
coroutines that want to work in similar ways. So if you had *twenty*
five-line snippets you wanted to write that way, it might become worth
it. But if you'd already written the first 19 in ordinary non-coroutine
style, then when you got to the break-even point, it might *still* not
seem worth your while to go to the effort of writing the promise class
*and* converting all the existing cases to use it...

(Also, this is only a temporary complaint about C++. C++23 will bring
`std::generator`, which should make this kind of simple job *actually*
simple again.)

### Combine with input queues {#queues}

In TAOCP's presentation of coroutines, and many others, the whole point
is that you yield to the other piece of code precisely when you have
data to transfer. If a producer is constructing a stream of objects and
sending them to a consumer, then you write the producer as if it has a
function it can call for 'here, I have this object for you', and you
write the consumer as if it has a function for 'ok, what's my next
object?', and there's exactly one pair of transfers of control for each
object that traverses the boundary.

But sometimes that's not the best way to do it. When it's not, don't do
it that way!

One case where it's awkward is the [case I mentioned
previously](#uc-general) of having a coroutine that can receive more
than one type of input, and doesn't know which one will come next. For
example, PuTTY's SSH authentication layer used to implement password /
passphrase prompts itself, so it received a stream of events in which
SSH packets and user keystrokes were interleaved, and any call to the
main userauth coroutine might be providing *either* of those kinds of
event.

But if you're writing code in a coroutine-structured style, then in a
lot of cases, you know which input type *you* want to see next -- and
it's very annoying to have to put a handler for the other one after each
yield. For example, if you're *not* in the middle of presenting a
password prompt to the user, what do you do with a keystroke when you
receive one? Conversely, if you're waiting for the user to finish typing
a password, and another network packet comes in, what do you do?

In those early versions of PuTTY, I mostly ignored the problem. While
the userauth coroutine was waiting for network packets, if it was called
with a keystroke, it would simply discard it -- drop it on the floor.

An effect of that was that you couldn't open a PuTTY window and
immediately start typing the first shell command you wanted to run in
your session, *even* if you knew that authentication was going to
succeed without needing any prompts (say, because you were using an SSH
agent). You'd expect to be able to 'type ahead', and have your
keystrokes buffered until the main shell session was ready to use them.
Instead, for as long as authentication hadn't finished yet, they'd just
be thrown away.

After a while, that became annoying. I wanted keystrokes to *never* be
dropped. But I also wanted to write my userauth coroutine in the most
convenient way. What to do?

Instead of passing SSH packets or keystrokes directly to the userauth
coroutine, I made two *queues* in the SSH layer, to hold SSH packets and
user input respectively. So when the lower layer had a packet to deliver
to the userauth layer, it wouldn't pass the packet directly to the
userauth function; instead, it would put the packet on the userauth
layer's incoming packet queue, and then call the userauth function with
no arguments, just saying 'hello, it's worth waking up and checking your
queues'. And the same went for user input.

This solved my problem. Now, when userauth knows the next thing it's
expecting is an SSH packet, it can run a little resume loop that says
'Is there a packet waiting in my queue? If not, suspend, and look again
when we're resumed.' If user input arrives in the meantime, it goes on
the *other* queue, and will still be there when the userauth layer gets
to a different place in the code where it needs some user input -- or
perhaps it won't be consumed by userauth at all, and will be picked up
by the connection layer (the one that runs shell sessions after you log
in), so that you *can* type ahead into the shell prompt you expect to
see later.

In particular, sometimes the userauth layer wouldn't need to suspend
itself at all. It would look at its queue and discover there was
*already* something there, and charge straight on without ever having to
yield.

(In C, using preprocessor coroutines, this little loop was the easiest
way to wait for a particular one of the possible input events. If I were
rewriting this code using the C++20 coroutine system, I could formalise
it, by defining a specific `co_await` idiom for 'now I want to wait
until there's something in this queue'. That could be set up so that it
would avoid resuming the coroutine *at all* until that queue stopped
being empty -- and it could also automate the initial check of 'maybe we
don't even need to suspend at all because we already have a packet
waiting'.)

Another case where queues are useful is if the data objects are very
small and numerous. For example, if you wanted to write a coroutine that
received a stream of *bytes* from another part of the program -- say,
because the producer was a file decompressor, or the consumer was a file
compressor -- then it would be bad for performance to require two
coroutine-transfer overheads per individual byte. Instead, the producer
would prefer to provide as many bytes in one go as it conveniently can
(especially since it might have read lots of them in a block from a
file, or a decompressor might have generated a lot at a time from a
run-length record or an LZ77 copy). But then the consumer might not need
exactly that many for *its* next operation. So it would make sense to
append bytes to a queue (probably in the form of a circular buffer, or
chain of small buffers, or something else space-efficient per element).
The producer could generate as much data as was convenient (or would fit
in the buffer), and then yield at the point when producing the next byte
would need actual effort; then the consumer could eat as much of the
queue as possible, and yield back when it wanted more bytes than were
available.

But, just like I've been saying about everything else in this article,
don't take it to extremes. Using an input queue or buffer isn't *always*
the right thing. One of the effects of representing a stream of data as
a coroutine is that the stream is lazily evaluated: no element is
computed until it's really needed. So if some or all of the data values
are *expensive* to compute, then either don't use an intermediate queue
at all, or else make sure you never put more than one thing in the queue
*unless they're easy*.

(`spigot` is a good example of this problem. The coroutines in that are
mostly generators that yield streams of integer matrices. For some
generators, the matrices are uniform and simple; for others, an
occasional matrix is *exceptionally* costly to compute. So in that
application, queues didn't seem worth the effort; yielding exactly once
per matrix is the simplest way to be absolutely sure that we never even
start trying to compute a matrix until its consumer knows it's needed.)

### Combine with ambient pre-filters {#handlers}

Here's one more trick on the theme of 'only use coroutines for the
coroutine-shaped parts'.

Sometimes, a stream of data contains things that have to be handled
sequentially, *interleaved* with things that should be handled the same
at any time.

An example of this is the key-exchange 'transport layer' of SSH. This
includes all the packet types I mentioned [earlier](#adapter) (the
`KEXINIT` start packet, various sequences of packets to perform
different key exchanges, and a `NEWKEYS` message to signal that you're
about to switch to the newly generated encryption keys); but it *also*
includes a small number of messages that can arrive at any time and must
be handled correctly when they do.

The handling isn't always *difficult*. One key example is the `IGNORE`
message, which either side may send at any time, and the other side --
as suggested by the name -- must ignore it. That's the single easiest
possible way to handle a packet.

But now suppose you've written your transport layer in the form of a
coroutine. There will be lots of separate points in the code where you
yield, wait for the next packet, and expect it to be of a particular
type (typically, whatever comes next in the key exchange you're
performing). Now *every one* of those yield points has to have an extra
check for the `IGNORE` message, which loops round to get the packet
after it:

::::: flexcontainer
::: flexitem
    // What you’d like to write
    function transport_layer() {
        // ...
        pktin = co_await PacketInputQueue;
        if (pktin.type != FOO)
            disconnect("got packet type %s, wanted FOO");
        // ...
    }
:::

::: flexitem
    // What you have to write instead every time
    function transport_layer() {
        // ...
        while (true) {
            pktin = co_await PacketInputQueue;
            if (pktin.type != IGNORE)
                break;
        }
        if (pktin.type != FOO)
            disconnect("got packet type %s, wanted FOO");
        // ...
    }
:::
:::::

If you've got even ten or twenty yield points in your coroutine, this is
a lot of tedious boilerplate code -- and worse, a lot of places to
accidentally leave out that extra clause, and introduce a latent bug
that will only show up when a server actually *does* happen to send
`IGNORE` in that particular context. And it only gets worse when you
have to support the rest of SSH's any-time message types. Ignoring that
`IGNORE` message *isn't* the easiest thing in the world, it turns out!

So don't do it that way.

Instead, a structure I've found useful is to have a 'pre-filter' on the
queue, which isn't part of the coroutine at all. Whenever new packets
arrive on the queue, they're seen first by the pre-filtering code. That
will handle things that can arrive at any time, like `IGNORE` and its
friends. The only remaining packets are the ones that *are* expected to
appear in a sensible sequence that's natural to write as a coroutine.
And *those* are passed to the main transport-layer coroutine, which can
handle them in the natural way, without having to do anything at a yield
point that isn't related to what that *particular* yield point is trying
to achieve.

So this lets the coroutine handle only the coroutine-shaped parts of the
protocol: the things that happen in sequences, or conditionally, or in
loops, and look like control flow. Meanwhile, the awkward things that
can interrupt your nice orderly control flow are simply removed from the
coroutine's view of the input and handled by a central dispatch
function. Then each style of code can do what it does best; or, looking
at it the other way round, each part of the problem can be solved in the
way that's most natural for that part.

(*How* do you wedge this pre-filter system into a world organised by
coroutines? PuTTY uses C preprocessor coroutines, in which there's a
convenient slot within the coroutine function itself -- just before the
`crBegin` macro -- where you can put code that will run on every single
resume, before control is transferred to wherever the function last
suspended. For languages which implement coroutines natively, that slot
probably doesn't exist, so you'll have to do it the more pedestrian way
of hiding the coroutine resume operation behind a separate wrapper
function, and having that wrapper do any pre-filtering necessary before
resuming the actual coroutine.)

The SSH packets I've been talking about here are fixed. They can be sent
at any time at all in the protocol, and they *never* want to be handled
by the coroutine code. But in other situations, there are message types
which you *sometimes* want to handle in the sequential coroutine code,
even though at other times you'd rather they were handled by the
pre-filter so that the sequential code can concentrate on something
else.

In this situation, you can still keep the sequential code in the
coroutine and the any-time handlers in the nicely separate filter
function, by means of the coroutine setting variables that affect how
much the filter function filters. Then the coroutine can dynamically
control what subset of the inputs it sees, and always focus its
attention on the ones that behave sequentially.

Those variables can be as simple or as complicated as you like. It might
be as simple as having a single boolean flag saying whether the
coroutine would currently like to see whatever kind of thing is only
sometimes interesting to it. Or you might need some kind of set variable
saying which types of thing you currently care about. Or maybe the
filter might need to be a complicated lambda function, who knows. It
will depend on how much control you need to have over the filter.

One idea along these lines that I haven't yet had the opportunity to try
is to have a *lexically scoped* handler, installed for the duration of a
particular block of code, and uninstalled again automatically by an
object's destructor. It might look something like this (details
completely made up):


    function event_stream_consuming_coroutine() {
        // Here, we can receive any event type
        event = co_await EventQueue;

        {
            // Install a handler for a particular event we don’t want
            // to be bothered with in the next loop
            HandlerInstaller hi(EventQueue, EVENT_BORING, lambda(event) {
                fixed code to handle this event;
            });

            // Now do some kind of a loop over the remaining event
            // types, which can assume EVENT_BORING never appears.
            while (some condition) {
                // imagine lots of subsidiary control flow here
                event = co_await EventQueue;
            }

            // At the end of this block, the HandlerInstaller object
            // goes out of scope, and its handler is uninstalled
        }

        // And here we’re back to being able to receive any event,
        // even EVENT_BORING
        event = co_await EventQueue;
    }

The idea is that the `HandlerInstaller` class has a constructor which
arranges to add the specified event type to the pre-filtering system
sitting in front of this coroutine. In this example, I've also shown it
taking a lambda function as an argument, so that we can say *what* to do
with one of those `EVENT_BORING` events if it happens within this block.

Then, when the `HandlerInstaller` goes out of scope at the end of the
block, its destructor runs, and uninstalls the handler again. So after
the block ends, `EVENT_BORING` is no longer being filtered out of the
coroutine's input, and the final `co_await` could receive one.

I haven't had a chance to experiment with this style yet, because you
can't do it with preprocessor coroutines. (Not even in C++, where you do
have destructors. Preprocessor coroutines in C++ require all the
coroutine's persistent variables to be members of its containing class,
so they can't be scoped to sub-blocks of a function.) But you could do
it in C++20's native coroutines, where you get to declare block-local
variables in a natural way. So when I write my first real system based
on C++20 coroutines, I might give it a try!

## Coroutine paradigms {#features}

Finally, in this last section, I'll talk about some different ways to
*think* about coroutines, in the sense of what kind of thing they even
are.

I've mentioned a couple of things of that kind in passing, in previous
sections: I said that coroutines can be seen as the in-process analogue
of a Unix pipe, or as the imperative-programming analogue of lazy
evaluation (particularly something like Haskell's lazy lists). But those
were more about the kind of *tasks* you can use them for; the next few
sections will be more about what they *are* than what you can use them
as.

### TAOCP's coroutines: symmetric, utterly stackless {#taocp}

Knuth's presentation of coroutines in The Art of Computer Programming
calls them a 'generalisation' of subroutines. That characterisation
doesn't make sense in all contexts, but in that particular context, it
does.

In TAOCP, all the example programs are written in machine code for the
fictitious MIX architecture. MIX is strange by modern standards --
entire generations of CPU architecture fashion have come and gone
*between* MIX and the more-or-less RISC architectures of today.

In particular, MIX has no real commitment to the existence of a *stack*.
Typical CPU architectures of today consider a stack to be a fundamental
necessity: there's a special register reserved for use as the stack
pointer, which it's either impossible to use for any other purpose, or
at least highly inadvisable. Too much of the design is based on the
assumption that *of course* you'll want a stack.

But in MIX, nobody is making you use a stack. And Knuth, in many cases,
doesn't. His example MIX programs are generally set up so that each
function has just one copy of its variables, stored at fixed addresses
-- and when one function calls another, the return address is just
another of those variables.

This way of organising code works fine for every purpose except
recursion (and multithreading): if a function's variables always live at
the same address, it follows that you can't have two independent
instances of the function active at once. So a function may never call
itself, either directly or through any other chain of intermediate
functions. Or rather: if you *do* need a particular function to have
multiple concurrent activations, you'll have to make a special effort to
enable it to do so -- for example, by manually implementing a stack
inside that function.

(It's surprising to the modern eye how little emphasis TAOCP puts on
recursion, in fact! Current treatments of programming tend to consider
it to be one of the most fundamental and important techniques, to be
taught early and used often. By contrast, Knuth clearly *knows* about
it, but is able to get a startling amount done without having to resort
to it.)

Anyway. The relevance of all this to coroutines is:

The MIX subroutine call instruction works like most RISC call
instructions: rather than pushing the return address on to a stack in
memory, it simply writes it into a particular register called rJ, and
then it's up to the callee to decide what to do with it. So a normal MIX
function call works by the caller doing one of these jumps, and then the
callee saves the rJ register in one of its own memory locations

^7^[In fact, Knuth does this by self-modifying code. The memory location
where you save the return address is actually the destination-address
field *within the jump instruction* that performs the
return!]{.footnote-text}[7]{.footnote-label-right}, so that it can
remember where to jump back to at the end of its task.

The MIX call instruction is also its normal jump instruction. (rJ isn't
used for anything else, so that's generally safe.) So the callee uses
the same instruction when it returns, to transfer back to the caller.
The only difference is that the caller jumps to the *start* of the
callee, whereas the callee saves the rJ register on entry and jumps to
wherever it said. On return, the caller *also* receives a value in rJ,
because that jump instruction updated it too -- but it ignores it,
because it doesn't care which particular place in the callee control
came back from.

And that's the sense in which coroutines 'generalise' subroutines. With
subroutines, each side receives a value in rJ, but only one of them
bothers to remember it. With coroutines written in MIX in this style,
the only difference is that *both* sides remember the value they receive
in rJ, and *both* sides use it as the place to transfer control to next.

So, unlike most languages' built-in coroutines (and certainly unlike my
C preprocessor approach), this setup is completely symmetric. There is
no sense in which one of the two functions 'really is' the caller, and
the other one is just 'pretending to be' the caller using a special kind
of yield statement. Each one is doing exactly the same thing as the
other. They are *co*-routines, in the sense of "equal partners".

### A subroutine that can resume from where it last left off {#resumable-callee}

Of course, in modern CPU architectures, there *is* a stack. And in
almost all high-level languages (by which, in this case, I mean 'any
higher than assembly' -- even COBOL counts), there will be a function
call and return system that assumes a stack, and each function will
store its local variables on the stack. So if we want to have functions
interoperating in a coroutine style, and each of those functions
occupies a region of memory on the call stack, then one function is
going to *have* to be higher up the stack than the other.

This introduces an ugly asymmetry into the perfectly symmetric system
Knuth described. We have to make an arbitrary decision about which way
up to order the two functions on the stack, and whichever way round we
make the decision, you might reasonably ask "Why wouldn't it be just as
good to do it the other way?"

But it has to be done, so we make a choice, and designate one of our
formerly equal coroutines as the 'caller' and one as the 'callee'. What
are the consequences?

An invariant of the conventional stack-based function call system is
that the currently executing function must be the deepest one on the
stack. You just aren't allowed to have extra stuff occupying stack space
below

^8^[For the sake of not using too many words, I'll assume the most
common convention for stack layout, which is that the stack grows
downwards in memory: pushes make SP smaller, pops make it bigger, and
when you call a subroutine, its stack frame is below yours. If you're
used to one of the rare architectures that does things the other way up,
just turn your head upside down while reading this
section.]{.footnote-text}[8]{.footnote-label-right} the frame of the
current function. (One reason is that asynchronous things like signal
handlers or interrupts might overwrite that space without warning.)

So, when the caller is executing, *the callee can't have a stack frame
at all*. There would be nowhere for it to live.

Therefore, when the caller transfers control to the callee, the callee
has to *construct* a stack frame. And when control transfers back the
other way, that stack frame has to be thrown away again. So the physical
view of what's happening on the stack looks exactly like the caller
making multiple independent calls to some subroutine: each time, a new
stack frame is created, lives briefly, and is destroyed again.

The only differences between this and an ordinary subroutine is that the
callee coroutine has to preserve all its variables between calls --
which means they have to be stored somewhere *other* than on the stack
-- and that every time it's 'called', it has to resume from just after
wherever it last returned from.

This is the compromise that most languages' coroutine systems end up
settling on. My C preprocessor coroutine system is exactly this: a
coroutine-structured function contains a macro at the start that can
arrange to transfer control to any of the yield points in the function,
and at each of those yield points, a variable is updated to mark that
point as the one to resume from next time, and then the yield macro
executes the ordinary C `return` statement. So the function's physical
stack frame is destroyed (which is OK because all the important state is
kept in a `struct` elsewhere), and on the next call, a fresh stack frame
is created.

The same is true of C++20 coroutines; it's better hidden, but the
low-level code generation will be doing basically this if you look deep
enough. I expect the same is true of other languages that compile to
ordinary stack-based native code.

This 'resumable subroutine' architecture has consequences beyond the
details of the low-level implementation. Here are two:

Firstly, what happens if you want to divide up the work of the callee
coroutine into subroutines? (For example, in Python, a generator can
`yield from` another generator, so that the second one runs to
completion and delivers all its results to the same place as the first
generator.) The most obvious way to implement a 'sub-coroutine' is to
have the parent coroutine call it repeatedly in a loop, passing its
results back one by one:

    function parent_coroutine() {
        yield START;

        // Make an instance of a sub-coroutine
        coroutine_instance sub = sub_coroutine();
        // And run it to completion, passing on all its yields
        while (sub is not finished)
            yield sub.next_yielded_thing();

        yield END;
    }

Now if even the *parent* coroutine is having its stack frame demolished
completely on every yield, then the same thing must be happening to the
sub-coroutine. So if we nest sub-coroutine 'calls' *n* layers deep, then
every time the innermost one yields and resumes, the implementation will
have to tear down *n* stack frames and set them all up again. *The
resumable-subroutine model makes deeply nested sub-coroutines expensive
in performance.*

There might be a way to get round this, one way or another. For example,
in C++20 coroutines, you can [set up a promise
class](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/#stacked-generators)
in such a way that the logical 'stack' of sub-coroutines never occupies
the physical stack all at once: instead, at each stage, a physical stack
frame is only needed for the *currently executing* coroutine in the
logical stack. But it's not necessarily the *default* way that things
will work, so it's something you have to keep in mind and watch out for:
if there's a special way to avoid this stack usage problem, remember to
do it if your nesting gets too deep, and if there isn't one, don't *let*
your nesting get too deep.

Secondly, if your language supports exceptions, what happens if a
coroutine throws one?

Exceptions propagate up the physical stack. So if the callee coroutine
throws an exception, it can propagate out into the caller. (For example,
an exception in a Python generator propagates out into the function that
called `next()` on it.) But if the caller throws an exception, it can't
propagate in the reverse direction.

It may be possible to configure this to some extent. C++20 coroutine
systems let you explicitly control what happens to an exception thrown
in the coroutine. But you still can't propagate an exception from
'normal' code *into* a coroutine by any sensible method.

So, if you care about exceptions, perhaps that might drive your choice
of which of those two 'equal' coroutines to turn into the caller, and
which the callee: in which direction (if any) would you like exceptions
to travel between the two? Whichever direction that is, it might be
easiest to make that 'up the stack'.

(And if, in some extra-confusing scenario, you want exceptions to be
able to travel in *both* directions -- maybe based on the type of the
exception -- then you *really* have a challenge on your hands. Good
luck, and have fun.)

### Cooperative threads that identify which thread to transfer to next {#cothreads}

I performed a minor sleight of hand in the previous section. Did you
spot it?

I said: if we want two functions to interoperate in coroutine style, and
each one occupies a region of the stack, then one function has to be
higher up the stack than the other.

But hang on. "The" stack? *Who said there was only one?*

This is the 2020s, and we've met multithreading by now. So we're already
used to the idea that a complicated program might contain *multiple*
stacks, in widely separated regions of memory. We could put our two
interoperating coroutines on *separate* stacks.

This immediately solves the problem of sub-coroutines. Now each
coroutine is free to be reorganised into as many subroutines as it
likes, without impacting performance by having to forward values up and
down a long chain, or having to constantly destroy and rebuild physical
stack frames. Either stack can yield to the other, no matter how deep
it's currently nested; when it does, execution resumes in the other
stack from wherever it left off, by restoring the *stack pointer* as
well as the location within the current function.

Working in this style, it becomes natural for sub-coroutines to have a
'return value', separate from whatever data they yielded. (For example,
C++20 has `co_return`, separate from `co_yield`.) Just as an ordinary
function performing I/O can return a value to its caller indicating
success or failure, or returning the result of its I/O operation, a
sub-coroutine that you call to yield on your behalf can return a value
to you, perhaps communicating the same kind of thing.

Having two stacks restores the elegant symmetry of MIX's coroutines:
once again, our two (or more) stacks are equal partners in the program's
overall endeavour, with neither one being forced to take an artificially
subordinate role.

But this is also what I meant when I said earlier that Knuth's account
of coroutines as 'a generalisation of subroutines' didn't make sense in
all contexts. In *this* model, coroutines and subroutines aren't more
and less general versions of the same concept: they're *independent*
concepts, and you have both of them at once. I like to imagine them at
right angles to each other: coroutine transfers go left or right between
stacks, whereas subroutine calls or returns go up and down within a
stack.

OK. So: if each of our coroutines comes with its own stack, then doesn't
that make them a lot like threads? What's the difference?

Firstly, these coroutine stacks are *cooperative*. Control only
transfers between them when they ask for it on purpose. This makes them
unlike ordinary threads, which are pre-emptively switched by the OS
kernel, or (better still, if possible) actually run simultaneously on
more than one CPU of your multi-core computer.

This cooperative nature makes it easy to avoid the synchronisation
problems of real threads. You don't need to take out a lock to stop
another coroutine stack from accessing the same data as you: all you
have to do is *not yield to it* while you're in the middle of a critical
section, and then it's guaranteed not to be running at the time.

Cooperative multithreading isn't totally unheard of even in normal OS
contexts. In the late 1980s, for example, RISC OS came out, which was a
GUI operating system that let you run multiple programs at once, but it
was cooperatively multithreaded

^9^[RISC OS is still around the last time I heard, and will run on a
Raspberry Pi in particular. I have no idea if it's *still* cooperatively
multithreaded, though. Wikipedia seems to say it is, but its most recent
citation is from 2003...]{.footnote-text}[9]{.footnote-label-right}:
your program would continue running without interruption until you
called the 'wait for a GUI event' system service, and only then would
the OS switch to running another process. And until *that* process made
the same system call, *you'd* never get control back.

But when you did that, you didn't know which other program would run
next. It wasn't really your business to know: the other programs were
independent of you. If you exchanged data with another program at all,
it would be mediated through the OS, perhaps via drag-and-drop or
copy-and-paste, and you might not care *what* other program it was, only
that it was providing data you had to do something with.

But in a coroutine-organised program, the data flow between the
coroutines is highly structured, and the whole point. If you're a
coroutine stack acting as an adapter in between a producer and a
consumer, then you most certainly do care which stack runs next: the
consumer mustn't run until you have a data item ready for it, and the
producer mustn't run until you've disposed of the one you're holding.

That's the other vital difference. Coroutine stacks get to *identify
which stack to switch to next.* That adapter thread doesn't just 'yield
to whoever has something to do': it has two fundamentally different
operations, 'yield to the producer' and 'yield to the consumer'.

So, that's my third model of what kind of thing coroutines can be.
They're like cooperative threads, except that switching between them is
done in a manner like a coroutine yield rather than like a system call:
the yielding 'thread' chooses which 'thread' is going to run next, and
maybe passes it a data object of some kind, which it might need in order
to resume running at all.

I've been talking about the CPU's physical call stack structure
throughout this section, but now I'll contradict myself by saying that,
at the physical low level, depending on the language implementation, the
'stack' of each of these 'threads' need not *actually* look anything
like a physical call stack.

You *could* make it look like one. You could allocate a piece of memory
for a coroutine stack; let the coroutines on it push and pop stack
frames like ordinary function calls; and have a special 'yield' function
that swaps out the stack pointer and switches over to executing on
another stack. In fact, that's not a bad way to add coroutines to a
language that doesn't already have them, because it doesn't need the
compiler to have any special knowledge of what's going on. You could add
coroutines to C in this way if you wanted to, and the approach would
have several advantages over my preprocessor system. (Though also some
disadvantages: this way, you have to anticipate every CPU architecture
your code will need to run on, and write and test the low-level stack
setup and switching code for all of them. Also, you lose the advantage
I'm about to talk about in the *next* section.)

But it's just as likely that a language's implementation of coroutines
will choose to do it another way. For example, in C++20, you can
certainly arrange for coroutines to be able to call each other as
subroutines, but the natural way to set it up involves the logical
'stack' of those calls being an array or a linked list inside the
coroutines' promise objects. A separate physical call stack is never
allocated, and (as I mentioned in the previous section) a call frame on
the existing physical stack is only allocated for the currently running
coroutine.

I'll end this section on an extra-confusing note: if the coroutine
stacks are kept in a format completely separate from the physical call
stack of a thread, that opens the possibility of combining stacks of
coroutines *with* conventional threads -- so that when a coroutine stack
has some work it can do, it could be resumed on the call stack of any
thread that was free!

### A named object identifying a program activity {#named-object}

Finally, I want to go back to a point I touched on in [a previous
section](#vs-threads).

While I was comparing coroutines to ordinary threads (pre-emptive or
genuinely concurrent), I mentioned that it's useful that a suspended
coroutine is always in a state where it can be conveniently destructed,
if the computation or data stream or activity it's producing is no
longer needed.

More generally, once you've started a coroutine and it's suspended
itself, there will typically be some kind of *object* in the programming
language that represents its state. That object will behave like any
other: you can assign it (or maybe a pointer to it) into a named
variable, and you can store that variable wherever you like. You could
have other objects contain pointers to activities they care about; you
could keep all your activities in an array; you could store each one in
a separate variable with an easy-to-remember name.

If your language supports automatically destructing things when they go
out of scope, this lets you tie the lifetime of the coroutine to some
other lifetime you already cared about. For example, if a particular
other class is consuming the coroutine's output, you can keep the
coroutine object inside that class, and then you *just don't need to
worry* about clearing it up: the coroutine will automatically be thrown
away exactly when nothing can possibly need its output any more, even if
it was only half-finished. And if it had any internal variables that
also needed cleaning up, that will all happen automatically too, because
the language should arrange that *their* destructors run. In a language
using RAII, even external resources like open files should be cleaned up
with no fuss.

(If your language *doesn't* support automatic destruction, you still get
an echo of this usefulness. For example, if you're using my preprocessor
coroutine system in C, then each coroutine already has to have a
structure type storing all its internal state. If you want to be able to
abandon an unfinished coroutine, then you have to accompany the
coroutine with a hand-written function that frees that state structure
and any subsidiary resources its fields point to. But in C, you're
accustomed to writing those functions all the time anyway, so coroutines
are no different -- and if a non-coroutine object of some kind owns a
coroutine state, then the free function for the first object will
naturally call the free function for the coroutine state. And *vice
versa*. So it's still natural to set up your code so that coroutines are
cleanly destroyed; C makes you do all the *work* yourself, but it's easy
to *organise* it sensibly. This is one of the reasons I mentioned in the
previous section for why I still use preprocessor coroutines in C
instead of low-level stack switching: it would be a much harder job to
free an in-progress *physical call stack* and all the resources
allocated by unfinished calls on it!)

An interesting thing about this 'conveniently destructible' nature is
that it wasn't anywhere in TAOCP's presentation of coroutines, and I
presume therefore not in earlier work either. (That's not *surprising*,
of course, since languages with automatic destruction weren't around in
those days.) I only really thought about it that way myself when someone
suggested to me the idea of combining coroutines with threads (as I
mentioned at the end of the previous section), and wondered what the
advantage might be over *just* using threads. I decided this was it: if
your in-progress activities are explicitly stored in a data structure
separate from the threads that are executing them, then you can abandon
an activity in an easier and cleaner way than destroying a thread. It's
always interesting when the most useful feature of a thing turns out to
be one that its originator never thought of!

Anyway. This is my final way of looking at coroutines: they allow you to
encapsulate a computation, or some other particular strand of your
program's activity (such as one among many network connections it's
handling), into an object which has a name in your programming language,
and can be accessed from outside the coroutine.

If you've expanded each coroutine into a call stack of its own, as I
discussed in the previous section, then this is still true: from outside
the coroutine stack, you still have *one* named object, which
encapsulates the whole stack. For example, if the coroutine yields data
values, then that object will be where the rest of the program goes to
get them: it will have the `next()` method, or the C++ iterable
semantics, or whatever the language finds convenient. Whichever layer of
the coroutine's internal call stack yields a value, the values will all
be delivered out of that same single object, without anyone outside the
coroutine stack having to know or care about the internal subdivisions.
And destroying that object should clean up the entire stack, even if it
had multiple layers of unfinished internal subroutine calls.

But having a named object identifying an activity is useful for more
things than just destroying it. Objects can also provide other methods,
or expose their internal data to the rest of the program on purpose.

For example, if you have a coroutine object that encapsulates the
progress of some activity, you might arrange that it presents methods
returning details of its progress -- perhaps a headline figure like '85%
complete' for the graphical progress bar, or perhaps details of the last
subdirectory it scanned, or what phase of a network connection it's in.
As usual, the advantage of doing this with coroutines rather than
threads is that there's no worry about concurrent access: if the
coroutine is suspended, then you can safely read its data (or at least
the data it's publishing on purpose).

You might also arrange that methods on the wrapping object can *modify*
the progress of the coroutine in some way. That case is harder to think
of good examples for, but they do sometimes come up.

One example of this comes up in an example I've already shown, from
PuTTY. In [a previous section](#protocol) I showed pseudocode of the
coroutine that handles the SSH transport layer, which periodically does
key exchanges. A repeat key exchange can be triggered by either side
sending the `KEXINIT` packet. In the pseudocode earlier I showed the
coroutine responding to the *other* end sending `KEXINIT`. But what if
*we're* the side that decides it needs to rekey first?

Suppose we had a function `trigger_rekey()` that the rest of the program
would call when it decided that needed to happen. That function could
construct a `KEXINIT` packet and inject it into the output packet queue.
When the other end responded with its own `KEXINIT`, the
`key_exchange()` coroutine would resume, and see it. But then how would
it know that in *this* case it shouldn't respond by sending one of its
own? Answer: the `trigger_rekey()` function also wants to set a flag *in
the coroutine's state* that says "We've already sent our `KEXINIT`,
don't send another one". Then `key_exchange()` sees the incoming
`KEXINIT` but also sees that the flag is set, so it goes back round to
the top of the loop without sending an unwanted extra `KEXINIT` first.
That's the kind of thing that an accompanying mutator method on a
coroutine might usefully do.

OK; what *else* can you do with a data object in a programming language,
as well as deleting it, reading its state, or changing its state?

Here's a *really* silly idea: you can *copy* it. Suppose you *cloned* a
coroutine object, together with all of its internal state?

Using my C/C++ preprocessor coroutine system, this is perfectly
possible. In that system, all the persistent variables of the coroutine
-- including the state variable that says where to resume from next --
have to live in an explicitly declared structure (in C) or be members of
a class (in C++). Either way, there's no difficulty with making an exact
copy: in C, you'd have to write a cloning function that dealt with
memory allocation and deep copying, but that's an easy mechanical job
and the structure definition lists all the fields you need to handle.
And in C++, you might very well be able to use the class's default copy
constructor and have it Just Work.

After you do that, you've got two copies of the coroutine, and each of
them will resume from the *same* part of the code when it next runs.
It's very like the Unix `fork` system call in that respect.

This isn't a *deliberate* feature of my preprocessor system; it's just a
thing that drops out naturally from the implementation strategy, and
turns out to be easy to do. I doubt that any language-native coroutine
system will be willing to do this stunt.

But if you *can* do it, what might it be useful for?

One thing that springs to mind is testing, if your coroutine accepts
input on each yield. Run the coroutine to a particular point, then
repeatedly clone it and try lots of different inputs on independent
copies of it, making sure that each one is handled correctly. This might
be a lot less expensive that running from the start of the coroutine to
the test point *again* for each test input.

Another possibility is to use the same idea at run time, to probe the
coroutine from outside and *find* an input that will cause it to respond
in a particular way. But I haven't thought of a use for that at all!

## Conclusion

I started writing this article because I wondered if I had anything in
particular to say about coroutines. Turns out I had quite a lot!

Perhaps this will convince a few more people to become coroutine fans.
Or perhaps it will give some existing coroutine users new ways of
thinking about them and using them. Or perhaps not, and everyone reading
this will decide I have weird opinions that they disagree with.

But it was fun to write, and helped me clarify my *own* thoughts. And
it's my blog so I can be self-indulgent if I want to. Thanks for
reading!

## Footnotes

With any luck, you should be able to read the footnotes of this article
in place, by clicking on the superscript footnote number or the
corresponding numbered tab on the right side of the page.

But just in case the CSS didn't do the right thing, here's the text of
all the footnotes again:

[1.](#footnote-win32-read-write) For example, in the Win32 API, if you
have a bidirectional file handle such as a serial port or a named pipe,
and you need to simultaneously try to read and write it, I think it
really *is* the least inconvenient thing to have two threads, one trying
to read the handle and one trying to write it. The alternative
`GetOverlappedResult` approach ended up being *more* painful when I
tried it.

[2.](#footnote-python-coroutines) I talk about generators as if they
were *the* coroutine system in Python, but in fact, they're one of two:
Python *also* has a [completely different kind of
thing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines)
that it actually uses the name 'coroutine' for, in which function
definitions start with `async def` and suspend with `await`. I've never
played with those, because generators are easier to get started with and
have scratched my generalised coroutine itch well enough. But at some
point I should at least give them a look.

[3.](#footnote-knuth) In TAOCP, one of Knuth's suggestions for a
producer/consumer chain is that you might be flexible enough to make a
runtime decision as to *whether* to run both parts interleaved as
coroutines, or whether to run them sequentially storing the intermediate
data on disk, depending on how much memory you have. I suspect this was
a more vital concern in the 1970s.

[4.](#footnote-pairwise) The non-cyclic version of this is also useful.
As of Python 3.10 that *is* in the standard library, as
`itertools.pairwise`, although I'm going to have to keep writing it by
hand until I can rely on Python 3.10 or better being widespread enough.
But as far as I know the cyclic version still isn't in `itertools`.

[5.](#footnote-StopIteration) Incidentally, yes, I know, there's another
special case that my code doesn't handle: if the input iterator has *no*
values, then the example version of `cyclic_pairs` shown here will raise
`StopIteration`, when perhaps you'd prefer it to silently generate an
empty output list. Before Python 3.7 this happened automatically,
because `StopIteration` was handled differently; in many of my own use
cases I never pass an empty list anyway. But if you were writing a
version general enough to go in `itertools`, you'd probably want to
check for that case properly.

[6.](#footnote-if-for-while) In my fantasy programming language, this
would *actually* be how the standard control structures were
implemented. The only primitives in the language itself would be 'goto'
and coroutines. *All* block-structured control flow commands, even the
standard things like 'if', 'for' and 'while', would be defined in the
standard prelude as small coroutines of this kind, implemented in terms
of 'goto'. Then they wouldn't need to be keywords!

[7.](#footnote-self-modifying-code) In fact, Knuth does this by
self-modifying code. The memory location where you save the return
address is actually the destination-address field *within the jump
instruction* that performs the return!

[8.](#footnote-stack-grows-downwards) For the sake of not using too many
words, I'll assume the most common convention for stack layout, which is
that the stack grows downwards in memory: pushes make SP smaller, pops
make it bigger, and when you call a subroutine, its stack frame is below
yours. If you're used to one of the rare architectures that does things
the other way up, just turn your head upside down while reading this
section.

[9.](#footnote-riscos) RISC OS is still around the last time I heard,
and will run on a Raspberry Pi in particular. I have no idea if it's
*still* cooperatively multithreaded, though. Wikipedia seems to say it
is, but its most recent citation is from 2003...
